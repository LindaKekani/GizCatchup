   <h1> My Journey Into IT</h1>
    

  <div>
    <p style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);"> My interest in It began in high school when I did CAT. One time they told us about how one can create a basic web page using html, but unfortunately, we didn't get into it.</p>
    <p> I went to a university in Pretoria and did Biochemistry. It was a lot but I enjoyed it.</p>
   <p style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);">A few years later, I took a STATA course. After that, I learnt a little bit about data science, during class I kept hearing about Python, so I decided to do some research on it.<br> This sparked that interest I had back in High School</p>
   <p>My nephews and I play a lot of games together since I spend a lot of time with my family, and their curiosity and our discussions about games- such as how we could change somethings from there- has fueled my interest into game development</p>
   <p>The thought of being a game developer excites and motivates me to continue pushing boundaries and reaching for new heights.</p>
