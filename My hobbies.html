    <p>Outside of school, I love spending time with my family and friends, doing anything and everything, <br> Whether someone wants us to go swimming, have a chilled moment indoors playing games or go do straineous activities, I am down for whatever, as long as there's no drama and I'm having fun!</p>  
   <p>Although I love spending time with loved ones, I love love love spending some quiet time in my room listening to some music, whatching movies and having some dance sessions- even though I'm not that good.<br> I also enjoy road trips with lovely music and good company.</p>
