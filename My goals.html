   <p style="font-size: medium;"> My goals are simple. Be the best version of myself, and be one of the greatests in academia and as a developer, <br> Create games suitable for kids of all ages, games I would let my future kids play.</p>
   <p style="font-size: medium;">The process of self-discovery never ends, and every stage of my life has shaped the person I am now. My identity is shaped by my never-ending curiosity, <br> enjoyment of many artistic mediums, endurance in the face of adversity, and awareness of the interconnectedness of all things. I am eager to continue weaving the beautiful tapestry of my life with the threads of experiences that will still be experienced as I stand on the edge of the future.</p>
