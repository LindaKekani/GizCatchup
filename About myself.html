    <h2> Academics and  Career building</h2>

    <body>My academic journey has been a rollercoaster of discovery and growth, <br>Throughout my life, I've been motivated by my curiosity. As a result I went on and did science in varsity. I loved it!</p>
    <p>Although the years spent in varsity were challenging, I have learnt and grown a lot, both personally and academically.These years were not just about studying, but also about developing friendships, accepting difficulties, and mastering the art of endurance.</p> 
    <p> <I> I am passionate, ambitious and driven. I love knowing how things work and why.    
    </I>  </p>
